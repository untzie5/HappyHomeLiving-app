# Terms of Service

## The app
Happy Home Living is an app for people who live together. It does not matter if it is only 2 people living together or more. This app is suitable for families, friends, roommates, spouses or couples. The purpose of this app is to make your home organized by being able to have a shared to do list, calendar/schedule, shopping list and being able to communicate without sending text messages about small matters. You can write small comments on a task with a small explanation or giving your roommate a heads up about being late from work. This way, it is easier to organize a living situation and help each other out and always stay up to date. 
Disclaimer: The Happy Home Living app is still under development and is only a prototype.

## Users
To use this app and its potential, every user must make their own user profile. This is to make it possible for users to connect to each other without every user joining the same household. 
The user is responsible for their own activity on the app and what they choose to post and who they invite into their household. 
It is also important that the user give the correct information needed. This is to be able to distinguish between the users and being able to send correct notifications to the user it is concerned with. 

## Data
All personal data and all personal content are owned by the users themselves. 
By agreeing to the Terms of Service, the user give permission to Happy Home Living to use their data for functionality within the app. This permission applies if the users account exists.  
All data is saved locally within a server. This means that whenever the server is refreshed, all data will be lost. 

## Using the app
Happy Home Living is only to be used for its intended purpose and not to anything beyond this. 
If a user misuses the intended purpose for Happy Home Living, it may lead to restriction or deletion of the user’s account. 
Disclaimer: The service may have some changes over time.

## Public contributions
All content added by a user in a household (for example something in the to do list) will be visible for every user in the same household. All content added to any of the functions within the app will also be deleted when deleting an account.  
Deleting an account
The user may delete their account whenever it is wished for. When deleting an account, all personal data, content and contributions will be deleted with the account. 

## Restriction and responsibility
Happy Home Living is delivered “as is”, as it is still under development. There will be no guarantee of availability or data storage. The developer of Happy Home Living would also inform users that all data may be lost with server restart. 

## Changes to the Terms
Terms and Conditions may change over time, and each user must accept the new terms of service when they change to be able to continue to use Happy Home Living. 

## Consent
All users must accept Terms of Service before using Happy Home Living. When deleting of an account, users will be able to withdraw their consent.

# Privacy policy

## Happy Home Living Privacy policy
Happy Home Living uses your personal data for login purposes only. This applies to all users of the app. Happy Home Living is currently only a prototype and is under development. 

## Data
Data collected will only be a personal “user-ID” and a personal password which the user choose themselves. The information is needed to identify the user in the system. This way, only household members have access to only their personal household. The app will not collect any personal data beyond this, and the data will only be used for logging in and to identify you within the app and when deleting.  By using Happy Home Living, the user accepts the use of their data. 

## How data is saved
The data is only saved within the server. No database is currently being used. This means that all data will be deleted when the server restarts. No data is shared with any third party. 

## Limitation and safety
All data is saved only temporarily, and the developer can not guarantee for any of your data being saved for a longer period. The data is only needed for further development to the prototype and only needed for basic safety but not fully on a production level.

## User right
All users have the right to know what data that is available. The user can also delete their own account whenever they like. All data will also be deleted with the account. All users are allowed to withdraw their consent at any time by deleting their account and to stop using the app whenever they feel like it. 

## Consent
All users must consent to the privacy policy before using Happy Home Living. Consent is given upon the account creation and can be withdrawn at any time by deleting the account. 

## Changes in the privacy policy
Note that the privacy policy may change over time. If any changes happen, the user must agree to the new privacy policy to be able to continue using Happy Home Living.
